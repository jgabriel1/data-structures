# Data Structures

This repository's only purpose is to store and showcase implementations of commonly
used data structures using **Python**.

## Motivation

I've watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ksXLhuy-w&ab_channel=ForrestKnight)
video and had the idea to try to implement some of the structures he talks about.

## Structures implemented so far:

- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Linked List**
- **Binary Tree**
